# quote-generator
In this project, I've built a random quote generator that displays a random quote to the user every time they press a "new quote" ,
i got the whole idea from the blog 
https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/creating-a-bare-bones-quote-generator-with-javascript-and-html-for-absolute-beginners-5264e1725f08/ 
which was written by Sophanarith Sok
anyway i modified the project that i get the quote from API using async functiion so i can fetch the data from other ProxyURL .
i used basic CSS styling but it's mobile responsive .
